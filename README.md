# Redis Server implement in Rust

this project is to learn rust and redis. This is self learning project, not for production use.
There are many redis server implement in rust and much better than this project. I think you should use them if you are looking for production ready redis server. Or the best way is to use redis itself.

## Goals

- 100% compatible with redis protocol
